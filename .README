# 🗣️ Talk About It (TAI) — V1

**Talk About It (TAI)** is a platform for thoughtful discourse through structured 1-on-1 (ISO) debates and group discussions, with topic-based discovery, interest tracking, and a space for continued thinking.

> 🧠 Purpose: To bring structure and meaning back into conversations online — one debate at a time.

---

## ✅ Version 1 (MVP) Scope

This MVP lays the groundwork for the TAI platform, focusing on core functionality and architecture, including:

- 👤 User registration & authentication
- 🧩 ISO Debates (1-on-1 text-based structured debates)
- 🧠 Thinking Space (personal thread of followed debates/bookmarks)
- 📰 Topic Feed (static and user-personalized mock)
- 🖥 Web App UI (React-based frontend)
- 🧠 Backend API (C# .NET Core with PostgreSQL)
- 🚦 Basic CI (GitHub Actions-based build/test flow)

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | React.js (Vite) + Tailwind CSS |
| Backend API | .NET 8 Web API (C#) |
| Auth | ASP.NET Identity (JWT-based) |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| Messaging Queue | Kafka (placeholder setup for later stages) |
| Real-Time (Phase 2) | SignalR (planned) |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |
| Deployment (optional later) | Azure App Services / Docker |

## 🧠 Core Concepts in V1

* **ISO Debates**
  Structured 1-on-1 debates with rounds, timers, verdict votes (text-based for MVP)

* **Thinking Space**
  A personalized space for following, bookmarking, and organizing debates by tag/topic

* **Topic Feed (Static)**
  Early version of the feed — mock trending and interest-tagged topics
